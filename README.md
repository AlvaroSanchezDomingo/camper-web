# camper-web

## Introduction
This project has been developed with academic purpose for web development module at High Diploma in Computer science at WIT Waterford Ireland. This project has been create to gain practice developing application in node.js powered by handlebars, hapi and mongoDB as a base structure. 
The aim of this project is to create a web app with a Point Of Interest approach. A “point of interest” (POI) is a location for which information is available. A POI can be as simple as a set of coordinates, a name, and a unique identifier, or more complex such as a three-dimensional model of a building with names in multiple languages, information about opening and closing hours, and a civic address. POI data has many applications,including augmented reality browsers, location based social networking games, geocaching, mapping and navigation systems.
In this specific project a POI is camper parkings. Each camper parking will contain a name, a description, pros and cons about the parking a location and a category. 
There are 4 categories in which the parking are devided, nature, private, public and campings. A user can signup for a new account and create new camper parkings. Pictures can also be added to a parking. There is a map location functionality when viewing a parking. The temperature for that specific location is also request to https://www.climacell.co/.
